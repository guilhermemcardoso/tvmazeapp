## Getting started

Clone the project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/guilhermemcardoso/tvmazeapp.git
//if you are using SSH:
$ git clone git@github.com:guilhermemcardoso/tvmazeapp.git
```
Access the project folder:
```

```
Install the dependencies
```
$ npm install
//or if you are using yarn
$ yarn
```
Install the pods (via Cocoapods) to complete the linking:
```

```
Before running the project locally, we need to configure our .env file. So, create a file in the project's root directory called `.env`. Its content will be something like that:
```
API_URL=https://api.tvmaze.com/
```
Start the metro server in a terminal tab:
```
$ npm run start
//or if you are using yarn
$ yarn start
```
And start the application in another terminal tab:  
```
$ npm run android //to run the android application
//or
$ yarn android

$ npm run ios //to run the ios application
// or
$ yarn ios
```
